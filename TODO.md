Current To-Do List:
=================================
- Read through package and understand code; read through vignette

- Miller: Add overlapping portfolio option, using "dplyr" functions

- Ziqi: Update current code to "dplyr" functions to boost speed when dealing with large data sets. Useful link: http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html

- Later: Create test cases of big data sets using ws.data package. Function to ws.data package: install.packages("ws.data", contriburl = "http://www.kanecap.com/R", type = "source")

- Later: Improve documentations

- Later: Do the following items on the original To-Do List

Original To-Do List: (Before 2015)

Thanks to Gabor Grothendieck for the following suggestions:

- Allow a formula interface:

backtest(ret.var ~ in.var + by.var, DF)

and maybe

backtest(ret.var ~ in.var | by.var, DF)

which would do a separate ret.var ~ in.var analysis for each level
of by.var.

- Allow backtest to still give full info, not just the spread (this
could be user specifiable) even if there is a by.var.  For example,
maybe the second formula above with a | could specify the full report.
